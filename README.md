## Available entities

In theory, all items listed [here](https://github.com/pkorpine/nr7101?tab=readme-ov-file#example-output) should be available as entities. The entities are generated dynamically, meaning they can vary from one device to another. They depend on what the device lets us see.

## Support

Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/zulufoxtrot/ha-zyxel/issues).
