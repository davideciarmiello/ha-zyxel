2. Click the big blue button above
3. Click Download and confirm
4. Restart HA

### Install manually

4. Restart your HA instance

## Adding a device

1. Go to HA Settings > Devices & Services.
2. Click Add Integration.
3. Search for Zyxel.

## Available entities

In theory, all items listed [here](https://github.com/pkorpine/nr7101?tab=readme-ov-file#example-output) should be available as entities. The entities are generated dynamically, meaning they can vary from one device to another. They depend on what the device lets us see.

## Support

Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/zulufoxtrot/ha-zyxel/issues).
